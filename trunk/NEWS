This file contains a summary of changes in released versions.  Please read the
ChangeLog file for a more detailed listing of changes/bug fixes.

1.1.91:
    - Complete redesign; input/output has been completely separated from
      action handlers allowing us to write front-ends.  Currently provided
      front-ends: batch (read from stdin, write to stdout), stream (the previous
      default CLI interface), and readline (nice prompt with command-line
      history).  Planned front-ends: gtk, qt.

1.1.2_rc2:
    - Added a few more tests.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed compile failure when building herdstat w/o ncurses support.

1.1.2_rc1:
    - Moved getcols() function from libherdstat as it really doesn't belong in
      the lib and just bloats it with another lib (ncurses).

    New features:
     - The --metadata option now displays package's LICENSE.
     - Added --keywords option for displaying package keywords.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed bug where --versions <category> didn't bail like it should.
     - Rewrote output formatter.  In the process, a few long time bugs were
       fixed.  Before a lot of the lines would have an extra ' ' causing weird
       formatting problems if the line was long enough. Fixed another bug: when
       highlighting was performed, the more colors used, the shorter the
       resulting line would be.  This was because the formatter wasn't taking
       into consideration the length of the invisble color escapes when
       calculating whether it'd fit on the current line.

1.1.2_alpha6:
    Broke out the convenience library residing in herdstat/ into its own
    package, libherdstat.

    *Much* improved --field implementation.  All of the --dev specific code has
    been factored out, meaning we should be able to use it for pretty much any
    container in any action handler.

1.1.2_alpha5:
    New features:
     - libcurl support - cleaner fetching implementation
     - The --dev option now supports a sub-option, --field which allows
       lookup of developers by a field other than their username.  For example,
       it is now possible to show all developers who were born in 1983 and who
       have the first name Michael with:

	    herdstat -d --field=birthday,1983 --field=name,^Michael

	The criteria, "1983", and "^Michael" respectively are treated as regular
	expressions.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed bug where longdesc's (in <pkg> tag of querycache.xml) were being
       assigned instead of appended, causing certain longdescriptions (those
       requiring >1 callback per <longdescription>) to be truncated, and thus
       invalid cache results.

1.1.2_alpha4:
    Lots of behind-the-scenes changes that should decrease the amount of time
    herdstat runs in ALL cases (although in most cases the difference is not
    noticable).  I ditched herdstat's global options template setup in favor
    of the good ol' singleton.  The convenience of the template setup did not
    overweigh the performance consequences.  This means the access functions
    now return references to the data, instead of copies.  Another result of
    this is that herdstat should now use less memory as well, although usually
    that is not an issue since in most cases herdstat will exit immediately.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed long time bug in pkg handler (-p) that caused metadata.xml's that
       don't list a herd (not even "no-herd") to not show up when --no-herd is
       specified.

1.1.2_alpha3:
    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed a bug in the dirname() function that was causing problems if the
       -H flag specified a file in the current directory.
     - Fixed bug that caused projectxml files to be fetched in the same dir as
       herds.xml even if -H or -C was specified (they should go in
       /var/lib/herdstat).

1.1.2_alpha2:
    Don't use pkg-config to set our xmlwrapp libs, as it links in 6 other libs
    that are unneeded.  This should result in a slightly smaller executable.
    It also allows us to run herdstat through valgrind now, which we could not
    do before due to linking with libgcrypt (indirectly though libexslt).

    Bug fixes:
     - Don't attempt to initialize or copy a va_list in the Exception class'
       copy constructor/assignment operator, as its implementation varies from
       arch to arch making it nearly impossible to do so in a portable fashion.
     - Added back missing fetch logic that I forgot to re-add after rewriting
       most of the portage xml code.

1.1.2_alpha1:
    *Many* behind-the-scenes changes.  Mostly code refactoring/cleanup.

    New features:
     - Use userinfo.xml if available to provide more information when
       specifying the -d flag.  This feature requires that the user be a Gentoo
       developer, as this file is not publicly available and requires a CVS
       checkout.  This led to two new command-line options: -C|--gentoo-cvs for
       specifying a Gentoo CVS directory (lookups for herds.xml and
       userinfo.xml will be relative to this location) and -U|--userinfo for
       specifying a path to userinfo.xml.
     - Configuration file now supports using variables such as ${HOME}.
       Currently only ${HOME} is supported, however if you'd find it useful to
       add others, just let me know.

1.1.1_p7:
    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed segv when parsing metadata.xml's that are iso-8859-1 (or possibly
       any non-UTF8) encoded (even though they shouldn't be).
     - Fixed bug where devaway's fetching function would fetch the devaway.html
       even if a local patch was specfied on the command-line.  This has the
       side affect of also fixing a failed test (away-test) since beu removed
       his away message that's been present since I added the test :)
     - Fixed bug that caused LOCALSTATEDIR/lastsync to be updated even when the
       (meta|pkg)cache was not being updated, meaning the cache wouldn't be
       updated even when needed (since lastsync was equivelent).

1.1.1_p6:
    Bug fixes:
     - Fix infinite loop if certain conditions are present when trying to do
       simple variable substitution (bug #104190).

1.1.1_p4:
    THE UTF-8 BUG IS FIXED (Not the glib one)! Even better, I've been able
    to get it to work with xmlwrapp and std::string, which means we no longer
    need to depend on glib,glibmm,libsigc++ just for Glib::ustring (which of
    course didnt work anyways).

1.1.1_p3:
    Added a few more tests.

    Bug fixes:
     - Added -L|--localstatedir option so that the local state directory can
       be decided at run-time.  This was mainly added so that we can run our
       regression tests from within a sandbox without having to hack around
       it with a call to addwrite in the ebuild.
     - Cache PORTDIR_OVERLAY in addition to PORTDIR so that caches will be
       regenerated if a different PORTDIR_OVERLAY is specified.

1.1.1_p2:
    Added regression tests.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed NULL pointer dereference causing a segmentation fault when
       'herdstat -p no-herd' is run.
     - Interpret metadatas with no herd specified (not even no-herd) as
       "no-herd".
     - Fixed bug that caused XML files listed in <maintainingproject> (in
       herds.xml) to not be fetched properly and fail with a failed mps()
       assertion.

1.1.1_p1:
    Bug fixes:
     - Interpret packages in a herd (have <herd>some_herd</herd> in metadata.xml)
       that have a maintainer of 'some_herd@gentoo.org' (and no other explicit
       maintainers) as a package with no maintainer.  Previously, this was not
       taken into account and thus did not show up in --no-maintainer output.
     - Programmaticaly determine current terminal width (if a termcap lib is
       found - we prefer ncurses over others) instead of parsing the output of
       'stty size'.

1.1.1:
    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed bug that occurs when a package directory exists in an overlay but
       no ebuild is present.  While the displayed results were correct, the
       overlay display would be invoked causing the user to think the results
       came from an overlay instead of PORTDIR.
     - Fixed bug in caching that would show the cached results for a query even
       if the cached query came from a different PORTDIR.

1.1.1_rc9:
    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed bug in vars_T that caused values specified in /etc/make.conf to
       not override pre-existing values set by /etc/make.globals.

1.1.1_rc8:
    Bug fixes:
     - Rewrote file utility classes from scratch to fix a few design issues and
       bugs.
     - Fixed bug in --nocolor output when a highlight occurs (highlight color
       was never cleared).
     - Fixed significant bug in portage tree regex search code.  An errant
       'not' caused the pkgcache to be used when empty (resulting in no
       results) and when the pkgcache wasn't empty, the tree was still
       traversed, resulting in slower results.
     - Fixed bug in --versions --count output (a sleu of new lines were
       displayed).
     - Fixed bug in package cache: overlays were not searched.
     - Fixed bug in --which --regex that caused packages that exist in an
       overlay but not in PORTDIR to not be displayed.

1.1.1_rc7:
    New features:
     - Broke out code from metadata cache that gets the list of all packages
       in the tree into it's own cache for use by other actions that only
       need a package list (mainly --find and --which).  Those actions no
       longer need to traverse every single directory in $PORTDIR on each
       invokation (only when the package list cache has expired).  Initial
       benchmarks show a significant speed increase (roughly 2/3).

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed significant bug in directory handling code (present since
       pre-1.1.0) where closedir() was never called upon object destruction.
     - Fixed another significant bug in progress_T (thing that displays pretty
       progress in percentage) that caused an inf loop if destructor is called
       for an instance when progress_T::start() was not called first (debug
       mode for example).
     - Fixed small bug in output formatter that caused user-defined highlights
       to fail to highlight properly in certain instances.
     - Fixed small bug in metadata display that caused weird output for
       packages who, rather than having a valid HOMEPAGE, have space-delimited
       words explaining there is no valid HOMEPAGE (herdstat was previously
       misinterpreting it as multiple homepage's and thus listing one on each
       line).  The unix2dos and dos2unix packages are examples of this.
     - Fixed bug in --which that caused a lookup to fail if the package exists
       in an overlay but not in PORTDIR proper.
     - Fixed quite a few bugs that prevented building/using herdstat on
       FreeBSD (many thanks to Diego (flameeyes) for testing/reporting).

1.1.1_rc6:
    New features:
     - Added support for config files.  herdstat will first read /etc/herdstatrc
       if it exists and then $HOME/.herdstatrc if it exists.  See the example
       config file included.
     - It is now possible to provide a user-defined list of words that the user
       wishes to be highlighted if they occur in herdstat output.  Previously,
       only the user's developer nick was highlighted (assuming the user was a
       developer of course).  Enable this feature by setting the highlights
       variable in ~/.herdstatrc to a space-delimited list of words.
     - It's now possible to specify --find --metadata to show the metadata info
       of the find results.

1.1.1_rc4:
    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed bug in metacache reading that caused packages with a maintainer
       but no herd (not even "no-herd") to interpret the developer as a herd
       (thus producing inaccurate search results).
     - Fixed bug in -p(d)m output.

1.1.1_rc3:
    New features:
     - Full metadata caching now takes place (in addition to the query results
       caching) instead of just caching the list of metadata.xml's.  Subsequent
       lookup is of course much faster (and even faster if the query results
       are also cached).  The --nopkgcache option has been replaced by 
       --nometacache.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed bug in ebuild_which() that caused 'herdstat -w <package>' to not
       find a package if the package directory exists in an overlay but no
       ebuild exists.

1.1.1_rc2:
    Rewrote large portions of the package handler (--package) to fix a major
    design flaw.

    New features:
     - Both --with-herd and --with-maintainer options are now interpreted as
       regular expressions, increasing the flexibility you have.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed missing include that caused compilation failure if both libxmlpp
       xmlwrapp aren't installed.

1.1.1_rc1:
    New features:
     - Added --away option for viewing devaway information.  Also, now
       whenever a developer name who is currently away occurs in the output,
       it will me marked with an asterisk.
     - 'herdstat -p' now caches it's results so that subsequent queries do not
       require parsing every single metadata.xml.  A --nopkgcache option was
       added to prevent cache lookup (the query is still cached, however).

1.1.0:
    Use libtool --silent for less verbose compile output.

    Bug fixes:
     - Added explicit pkg-config check for Gentoo bug 92788.

1.1.0_rc6:
    Moved EXAMPLES section of manual page to it's own file, doc/examples.txt.

    New features:
     - Added --with-maintainer and --no-maintainer options that act just like
       their herd counterpart (but of course only with --package) for doing
       reverse lookups.  Makes it easy to find packages in a herd that aren't
       explicitly maintained.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed broken 'herdstat -m' inside package directories.

1.1.0_rc5:
    New features:
     - Action handlers that involve searching portage now respect --timer so
       that we can time how long portage searches take.
     - You can now specify --metadata along with --package or --package --dev.
       Prior to this, you had to do 'herdstat -m $(herdstat -pq <herd>)'. This
       has a nice side-effect of being able to use things like --with-herd and
       only show metadata for packages belonging to a certain developer with a
       certain herd.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed major bug in --which where a wrong path would be returned if the
       queried package exists in an overlay, but a newer version exists in
       PORTDIR.
     - Fixed bug in <maintainingproject> XML file fetching (failed fetch
       truncated pre-existing copy).
     - Fixed bug when ambiguous package is encountered in the metadata action
       handler (didn't display the most important part, the category).
     - Fixed bug in version sorting code that caused versions with extra
       characters (openssl-0.9.7g fex) to not be sorted properly.

1.1.0_rc4:
    New features:
     - Added a --qa option.  If specified, herdstat will complain loudly if a
       QA-related problem is encountered (a category in
       $PORTDIR/profiles/categories doesn't exist or an XML validation error,
       for example).
     - Regex searches are now a bit faster if a literal category is used (only
       that category will be searched).

    Bug fixes:
     - /etc/portage/categories is now taken into consideration when generating
       the category list.
     - --find, --which, and --versions now respect --count.
     - Fixed the colors that get displayed in --metadata --nocolor or
       --versions --nocolor.
     - Fixed bug in --which caused by a missing continue statement.
     - Fixed bug in --package when two args are specified (one which doesn't
       exist), a newline was not displayed after the progress display.
     - Fixed bug in --package when --nocolor is specified, the first package is
       in color.
     - Fixed bug in --package when --verbose is specified, the package's
       longdescription was not displayed properly.
     - Fixed herds.xml XML handler to recognize the <maintainingproject>
       element.  herdstat now fetches and parses the specified XML file to
       obtain the developer information for that herd.  herdstat no longer
       things that the fonts herd has zero devs :)

1.1.0_rc3:
    New features:
     - Added a --enable-unicode configure option.  We use glibmm/libxml++ if
       enabled, xmlwrapp if disabled.

    Bug fixes:
     - Check to ensure that a file open() succeeded, displaying an error
       message otherwise (instead of a nasty failed assertion).
     - --timer on herds.xml parsing actions now works again.
     - Fixed long-time bug where whitespace in the herd description wasn't
       tidy'd, therefore causing funky output for herd descriptions with
       newlines and weird whitespace.
     - Fixed --with-herd that I broke when making it work with --regex.
     - Fixed bug where developers who typo their email address (specifically
       zhen@gento.org) show up as not existing in herds.xml (since we search
       for 'dev + @gentoo.org').

1.1.0_rc2:
    New features:
     - Added --regex and --extended for only displaying results that match
       the specified regular expresion (extended if --extended is specified).
     - More UTF-8 friendly.  There's still a glibmm ustring bug that's causes
       an exception to be thrown when displaying UTF-8 chars, but hopefully
       that'll be resolved soon.
     - New --find flag which displays the full category/package for any
       specified packages/regular expression.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed bug in version sorting code that failed to properly strip the
       revision number of version strings containing a suffix and a revision.
     - Fixed bug in version sorting code that assumed the text after a '_'
       was a prefix, therefore failing on package names that contain a '_'.
     - Fixed bug in version sorting code that assumed the '-r' was a revision
       when in fact it was part of ${PN}.  We now check to ensure that a
       digit is present after the '-r' before assuming it's a revision.

    herdstat now uses the superior libxml++ for XML parsing rather than
    xmlwrapp.

1.1.0_rc1:
    New features:
     - Added --no-overlay option that prevents overlays listed in
       PORTDIR_OVERLAY from being searched.
     - --versions now also shows whether the displayed query results came
       from an overlay.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed bug where --package would not search metadata.xml's if the
       specified herd/developer (mainly concerned about the latter) isn't
       listed in herds.xml.

1.1.0_pre2:
    New features:
     - --metadata now shows whether the displayed query results came from an
       overlay and if so, which one.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed bug where trying to view a herd with 0 developers would cause an
       abort.  Thanks to Torsten Veller (tove@gentoo.org) for the heads up.
     - Fixed bug where --metadata would show the metadata from an overlay but
       show HOMEPAGE and DESCRIPTION from an ebuild that was elsewhere (because
       that's what ebuild_which() returned) if the ebuild was "greater" than
       the ebuild in the overlay (ie. if the ebuild in portdir was 1.1 and the
       ebuild in overlay was 1.0).  Now --metadata shows the HOMEPAGE/DESCRIPTION
       from the "greatest" ebuild found in the same directory.

1.1.0_pre1:
    New features:
     - New --which option comparable to 'equery which' but a bit faster. This
       feature was too trivial not to add.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed bug where util::vars_T would fail to substitute a variable if it
       hadn't already evaluated it.
     - Fixed completion bug where if any previous option contained a 'm' or
       'q' it would assume -m or -q were specified and complete appropriately.
     - --metadata now shows the DESCRIPTION/HOMEPAGE from the *latest* ebuild
       (whereas before versions were only sorted with string comparison
       often resulting in inaccurate results).
     - Fixed bug that caused funky formatting in --metadata output when
       multiple url's are listed in ${HOMEPAGE}.

    Many, many, many behind-the-scenes changes/refactoring.  All utility/portage
    code has been moved to its own convenience library.  All utility stuff is
    still in the 'util' namespace, but the portage code has been put into its
    own 'portage' namespace.

1.0.2:
    New features:
     - --metadata now shows the package's HOMEPAGE (if it exists in the
       ebuild).  herdstat does it's best to try and perform variable
       substituion on any variable occurrences in HOMEPAGE in an attempt to
       improve readability. Also shows the ebuild's DESCRIPTION if a longdesc
       is unavailable in metadata.xml.
     - --metadata now supports --quiet.
     - Added --with-herd, a generalization of --no-herd (which is now
       shorthand for --with-herd=no-herd) for only displaying developer's
       packages that belong in the specified herd.
     - User can now run 'herdstat -m' with no non-option args if inside a
       package directory or category.
     - If $PORTDIR/metadata/timestamp exists, don't re-cache the metadata.xml
       list until it changes.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed bug where a std::runtime_error exception was thrown (and not
       caught) if the LC_ALL env variable is set to an invalid locale.

1.0.1:
    New features:
     - New --metadata option that displays metadata information for the
       specified package(s)/category(s).  Blame Obz for wanting this.
     - New --no-herd option that when specified with --package --dev only
       shows packages belong to herd "no-herd". Blame ciaranm for wanting
       this.

    Bug fixes:
     - package handler quirks fixed wrt to stuff that doesnt exist.

1.0:
    New features:
     - Added progress thinggy for metadata caching, since that's the biggest
       bottleneck.

    Bug fixes:
     - Use C++ version of isspace and tolower so that locale is considered.

1.0_rc2:
    New features:
     - Cache the metadata.xml list for 24hrs to reduce package lookup times.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed pretty big formatting bug that caused long lines to not be wrapped
       and indented properly.
     - Instead of cleaning whitespace of long strings (such as herd/package
       descriptions) in the XML handler for EVERY single element, only clean
       the stuff that will be displayed.  Reduces the number of calls to
       util::tidy_whitespace() from ~2700 calls to 133.  Makes a pretty big
       difference since it calls several STL algorithms.

1.0_rc1:
    New features:
     - Added --nocolor.

    Bug fixes:
     - Reverted gcc-4 warning fixes since they cause havoc with gcc-3.3.x.
     - Fixed exception if '-d all' is specified.

0.6:
    New features:
     - You are now able to specify both --dev and --package at the same time
       in order to query the packages maintained by a specific developer.
     - Added --count option.  Using this option would produce the same result
       as running 'herdstat ... | grep -v '^$' | wc -l'.

    Bug fixes:
     - Ignore --quiet if herdstat is invoked with no non-option arguments.
     - Fixed completion bug where stderr wasn't redirected, this causing 
       weird completion funkyness if an error occurred.
     - Ignore case when it comes to developer usernames, otherwise we get
       duplicates (ex: pyrania/pYrania).
     - Fixed bug where a newline would get displayed after a herd, even if
       the number of pkgs in that herd == 0.

0.5:
    New features:
     - When herdstat is run with no arguments, display a summary of statistics.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed borked --package output.
     - Remove backed-up copy of fetched herds.xml if it's unneeded.

0.4:
    New features:
     - Added --fetch for telling herdstat to forcibly fetch herds.xml.

    Bug fixes:
     - All funky looking output caused by extra whitespace within XML elements
       is now cleaned before being displayed.
     - '@gentoo.org' is now appended to any invalid email addresses that lack it.

0.3:
    New features:
     - Added --outfile command-line option that allows the user to easily send
       the output to the specified file instead of stdout.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed the errant parentheses in bash command-line completion.
     - Fixed user highlighting in --verbose output.
     - Fixed bug where output was explicitly being sent to stdout instead of
       the specified stream when --quiet was specified.
     - Fixed bug where 'herdstat -dv all' would display developer roles (which
       of course should only happen in herd output).

0.2:
    New features:
     - Herd output now show's herd's email address (if available).
     - Both --dev and the default action now support an 'all' target (for
       example 'herdstat all').
     - Bash command-line completion is now included.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed several fetching-related bugs. Now uses the cached copy of
       herds.xml (if it exists) if for some reason fetching fails. Also
       fixed a bug where (since we tell wget to clobber the old file) if
       wget fails, it writes a 0 byte file (and thus all queries fail).
     - PORTDIR determination code fixed/quicker.
     - Fixed bug where highlighting of the user's nick was done prior to
       sorting, thus causing the user's nick to always appear first in
       output.
