0.2:
    New features:
     - Herd output now show's herd's email address (if available).
     - Both --dev and the default action now support an 'all' target (for
     example 'herdstat all').
     - Bash command-line completion is now included.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed several fetching-related bugs. Now uses the cached copy of
       herds.xml (if it exists) if for some reason fetching fails. Also
       fixed a bug where (since we tell wget to clobber the old file) if
       wget fails, it writes a 0 byte file (and thus all queries fail).
     - PORTDIR determination code fixed/quicker.
     - Fixed bug where highlighting of the user's nick was done prior to
       sorting, thus causing the user's nick to always appear first in
       output.
