This file contains a summary of changes in released versions.  Please read the
ChangeLog file for a more detailed listing of changes/bug fixes.

0.6.1:
    New features:
     - Added --nocolor.

    Bug fixes:
     - Reverted gcc-4 warning fixes since they cause havoc with gcc-3.3.x.
     - Fixed exception if '-d all' is specified.

0.6:
    New features:
     - You are now able to specify both --dev and --package at the same time
       in order to query the packages maintained by a specific developer.
     - Added --count option.  Using this option would produce the same result
       as running 'herdstat ... | grep -v '^$' | wc -l'.

    Bug fixes:
     - Ignore --quiet if herdstat is invoked with no non-option arguments.
     - Fixed completion bug where stderr wasn't redirected, this causing 
       weird completion funkyness if an error occurred.
     - Ignore case when it comes to developer usernames, otherwise we get
       duplicates (ex: pyrania/pYrania).
     - Fixed bug where a newline would get displayed after a herd, even if
       the number of pkgs in that herd == 0.

0.5:
    New features:
     - When herdstat is run with no arguments, display a summary of statistics.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed borked --package output.
     - Remove backed-up copy of fetched herds.xml if it's unneeded.

0.4:
    New features:
     - Added --fetch for telling herdstat to forcibly fetch herds.xml.

    Bug fixes:
     - All funky looking output caused by extra whitespace within XML elements
       is now cleaned before being displayed.
     - '@gentoo.org' is now appended to any invalid email addresses that lack it.

0.3:
    New features:
     - Added --outfile command-line option that allows the user to easily send
       the output to the specified file instead of stdout.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed the errant parentheses in bash command-line completion.
     - Fixed user highlighting in --verbose output.
     - Fixed bug where output was explicitly being sent to stdout instead of
       the specified stream when --quiet was specified.
     - Fixed bug where 'herdstat -dv all' would display developer roles (which
       of course should only happen in herd output).

0.2:
    New features:
     - Herd output now show's herd's email address (if available).
     - Both --dev and the default action now support an 'all' target (for
       example 'herdstat all').
     - Bash command-line completion is now included.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed several fetching-related bugs. Now uses the cached copy of
       herds.xml (if it exists) if for some reason fetching fails. Also
       fixed a bug where (since we tell wget to clobber the old file) if
       wget fails, it writes a 0 byte file (and thus all queries fail).
     - PORTDIR determination code fixed/quicker.
     - Fixed bug where highlighting of the user's nick was done prior to
       sorting, thus causing the user's nick to always appear first in
       output.
