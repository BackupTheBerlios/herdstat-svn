This file contains a summary of changes in released versions.  Please read the
ChangeLog file for a more detailed listing of changes/bug fixes.

1.1.1_alpha1:
    New features:
     - Added --away option for viewing devaway information.  Also, now
       whenever a developer name who is currently away occurs in the output,
       it will me marked with an asterisk.
     - Caching of 'herdstat -p' queries now takes place.

1.1.0:
    Use libtool --silent for less verbose compile output.

    Bug fixes:
     - Added explicit pkg-config check for Gentoo bug 92788.

1.1.0_rc6:
    Moved EXAMPLES section of manual page to it's own file, doc/examples.txt.

    New features:
     - Added --with-maintainer and --no-maintainer options that act just like
       their herd counterpart (but of course only with --package) for doing
       reverse lookups.  Makes it easy to find packages in a herd that aren't
       explicitly maintained.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed broken 'herdstat -m' inside package directories.

1.1.0_rc5:
    New features:
     - Action handlers that involve searching portage now respect --timer so
       that we can time how long portage searches take.
     - You can now specify --metadata along with --package or --package --dev.
       Prior to this, you had to do 'herdstat -m $(herdstat -pq <herd>)'. This
       has a nice side-effect of being able to use things like --with-herd and
       only show metadata for packages belonging to a certain developer with a
       certain herd.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed major bug in --which where a wrong path would be returned if the
       queried package exists in an overlay, but a newer version exists in
       PORTDIR.
     - Fixed bug in <maintainingproject> XML file fetching (failed fetch
       truncated pre-existing copy).
     - Fixed bug when ambiguous package is encountered in the metadata action
       handler (didn't display the most important part, the category).
     - Fixed bug in version sorting code that caused versions with extra
       characters (openssl-0.9.7g fex) to not be sorted properly.

1.1.0_rc4:
    New features:
     - Added a --qa option.  If specified, herdstat will complain loudly if a
       QA-related problem is encountered (a category in
       $PORTDIR/profiles/categories doesn't exist or an XML validation error,
       for example).
     - Regex searches are now a bit faster if a literal category is used (only
       that category will be searched).

    Bug fixes:
     - /etc/portage/categories is now taken into consideration when generating
       the category list.
     - --find, --which, and --versions now respect --count.
     - Fixed the colors that get displayed in --metadata --nocolor or
       --versions --nocolor.
     - Fixed bug in --which caused by a missing continue statement.
     - Fixed bug in --package when two args are specified (one which doesn't
       exist), a newline was not displayed after the progress display.
     - Fixed bug in --package when --nocolor is specified, the first package is
       in color.
     - Fixed bug in --package when --verbose is specified, the package's
       longdescription was not displayed properly.
     - Fixed herds.xml XML handler to recognize the <maintainingproject>
       element.  herdstat now fetches and parses the specified XML file to
       obtain the developer information for that herd.  herdstat no longer
       things that the fonts herd has zero devs :)

1.1.0_rc3:
    New features:
     - Added a --enable-unicode configure option.  We use glibmm/libxml++ if
       enabled, xmlwrapp if disabled.

    Bug fixes:
     - Check to ensure that a file open() succeeded, displaying an error
       message otherwise (instead of a nasty failed assertion).
     - --timer on herds.xml parsing actions now works again.
     - Fixed long-time bug where whitespace in the herd description wasn't
       tidy'd, therefore causing funky output for herd descriptions with
       newlines and weird whitespace.
     - Fixed --with-herd that I broke when making it work with --regex.
     - Fixed bug where developers who typo their email address (specifically
       zhen@gento.org) show up as not existing in herds.xml (since we search
       for 'dev + @gentoo.org').

1.1.0_rc2:
    New features:
     - Added --regex and --extended for only displaying results that match
       the specified regular expresion (extended if --extended is specified).
     - More UTF-8 friendly.  There's still a glibmm ustring bug that's causes
       an exception to be thrown when displaying UTF-8 chars, but hopefully
       that'll be resolved soon.
     - New --find flag which displays the full category/package for any
       specified packages/regular expression.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed bug in version sorting code that failed to properly strip the
       revision number of version strings containing a suffix and a revision.
     - Fixed bug in version sorting code that assumed the text after a '_'
       was a prefix, therefore failing on package names that contain a '_'.
     - Fixed bug in version sorting code that assumed the '-r' was a revision
       when in fact it was part of ${PN}.  We now check to ensure that a
       digit is present after the '-r' before assuming it's a revision.

    herdstat now uses the superior libxml++ for XML parsing rather than
    xmlwrapp.

1.1.0_rc1:
    New features:
     - Added --no-overlay option that prevents overlays listed in
       PORTDIR_OVERLAY from being searched.
     - --versions now also shows whether the displayed query results came
       from an overlay.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed bug where --package would not search metadata.xml's if the
       specified herd/developer (mainly concerned about the latter) isn't
       listed in herds.xml.

1.1.0_pre2:
    New features:
     - --metadata now shows whether the displayed query results came from an
       overlay and if so, which one.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed bug where trying to view a herd with 0 developers would cause an
       abort.  Thanks to Torsten Veller (tove@gentoo.org) for the heads up.
     - Fixed bug where --metadata would show the metadata from an overlay but
       show HOMEPAGE and DESCRIPTION from an ebuild that was elsewhere (because
       that's what ebuild_which() returned) if the ebuild was "greater" than
       the ebuild in the overlay (ie. if the ebuild in portdir was 1.1 and the
       ebuild in overlay was 1.0).  Now --metadata shows the HOMEPAGE/DESCRIPTION
       from the "greatest" ebuild found in the same directory.

1.1.0_pre1:
    New features:
     - New --which option comparable to 'equery which' but a bit faster. This
       feature was too trivial not to add.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed bug where util::vars_T would fail to substitute a variable if it
       hadn't already evaluated it.
     - Fixed completion bug where if any previous option contained a 'm' or
       'q' it would assume -m or -q were specified and complete appropriately.
     - --metadata now shows the DESCRIPTION/HOMEPAGE from the *latest* ebuild
       (whereas before versions were only sorted with string comparison
       often resulting in inaccurate results).
     - Fixed bug that caused funky formatting in --metadata output when
       multiple url's are listed in ${HOMEPAGE}.

    Many, many, many behind-the-scenes changes/refactoring.  All utility/portage
    code has been moved to its own convenience library.  All utility stuff is
    still in the 'util' namespace, but the portage code has been put into its
    own 'portage' namespace.

1.0.2:
    New features:
     - --metadata now shows the package's HOMEPAGE (if it exists in the
       ebuild).  herdstat does it's best to try and perform variable
       substituion on any variable occurrences in HOMEPAGE in an attempt to
       improve readability. Also shows the ebuild's DESCRIPTION if a longdesc
       is unavailable in metadata.xml.
     - --metadata now supports --quiet.
     - Added --with-herd, a generalization of --no-herd (which is now
       shorthand for --with-herd=no-herd) for only displaying developer's
       packages that belong in the specified herd.
     - User can now run 'herdstat -m' with no non-option args if inside a
       package directory or category.
     - If $PORTDIR/metadata/timestamp exists, don't re-cache the metadata.xml
       list until it changes.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed bug where a std::runtime_error exception was thrown (and not
       caught) if the LC_ALL env variable is set to an invalid locale.

1.0.1:
    New features:
     - New --metadata option that displays metadata information for the
       specified package(s)/category(s).  Blame Obz for wanting this.
     - New --no-herd option that when specified with --package --dev only
       shows packages belong to herd "no-herd". Blame ciaranm for wanting
       this.

    Bug fixes:
     - package handler quirks fixed wrt to stuff that doesnt exist.

1.0:
    New features:
     - Added progress thinggy for metadata caching, since that's the biggest
       bottleneck.

    Bug fixes:
     - Use C++ version of isspace and tolower so that locale is considered.

1.0_rc2:
    New features:
     - Cache the metadata.xml list for 24hrs to reduce package lookup times.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed pretty big formatting bug that caused long lines to not be wrapped
       and indented properly.
     - Instead of cleaning whitespace of long strings (such as herd/package
       descriptions) in the XML handler for EVERY single element, only clean
       the stuff that will be displayed.  Reduces the number of calls to
       util::tidy_whitespace() from ~2700 calls to 133.  Makes a pretty big
       difference since it calls several STL algorithms.

1.0_rc1:
    New features:
     - Added --nocolor.

    Bug fixes:
     - Reverted gcc-4 warning fixes since they cause havoc with gcc-3.3.x.
     - Fixed exception if '-d all' is specified.

0.6:
    New features:
     - You are now able to specify both --dev and --package at the same time
       in order to query the packages maintained by a specific developer.
     - Added --count option.  Using this option would produce the same result
       as running 'herdstat ... | grep -v '^$' | wc -l'.

    Bug fixes:
     - Ignore --quiet if herdstat is invoked with no non-option arguments.
     - Fixed completion bug where stderr wasn't redirected, this causing 
       weird completion funkyness if an error occurred.
     - Ignore case when it comes to developer usernames, otherwise we get
       duplicates (ex: pyrania/pYrania).
     - Fixed bug where a newline would get displayed after a herd, even if
       the number of pkgs in that herd == 0.

0.5:
    New features:
     - When herdstat is run with no arguments, display a summary of statistics.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed borked --package output.
     - Remove backed-up copy of fetched herds.xml if it's unneeded.

0.4:
    New features:
     - Added --fetch for telling herdstat to forcibly fetch herds.xml.

    Bug fixes:
     - All funky looking output caused by extra whitespace within XML elements
       is now cleaned before being displayed.
     - '@gentoo.org' is now appended to any invalid email addresses that lack it.

0.3:
    New features:
     - Added --outfile command-line option that allows the user to easily send
       the output to the specified file instead of stdout.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed the errant parentheses in bash command-line completion.
     - Fixed user highlighting in --verbose output.
     - Fixed bug where output was explicitly being sent to stdout instead of
       the specified stream when --quiet was specified.
     - Fixed bug where 'herdstat -dv all' would display developer roles (which
       of course should only happen in herd output).

0.2:
    New features:
     - Herd output now show's herd's email address (if available).
     - Both --dev and the default action now support an 'all' target (for
       example 'herdstat all').
     - Bash command-line completion is now included.

    Bug fixes:
     - Fixed several fetching-related bugs. Now uses the cached copy of
       herds.xml (if it exists) if for some reason fetching fails. Also
       fixed a bug where (since we tell wget to clobber the old file) if
       wget fails, it writes a 0 byte file (and thus all queries fail).
     - PORTDIR determination code fixed/quicker.
     - Fixed bug where highlighting of the user's nick was done prior to
       sorting, thus causing the user's nick to always appear first in
       output.
